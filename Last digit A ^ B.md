## Complexity 21%

It is required to write a program that finds a digit that ends with the number AB.

INPUT consists of a single line containing two integers A and B, separated by a space (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10000).
OUTPUT you need to display the number to which AB ends.


| INPUT                             | OUTPUT                 |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| 2 2	  						    | 4                      |

## Complexity 15%


It is required to write a program that finds a digit that ends with the number `A`<sup>`B`</sup>.

The input consists of a single line containing two integers `A` and `B`, separated by a space `(1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10000)`.

In a single line of the output you need to display the number to which `A`<sup>`B`</sup> ends.

| INPUT | OUTPUT                 |
|-------|------------------------|
| 2 2   | 4                      |
| 3 7   | 7                      |
| 24 9  | 4                      |
