For given natural numbers N and K, it is required to calculate the number of numbers from 1 to N that have exactly K zeros in the binary notation.
For example, if N = 8 and K = 1, then we can write all the numbers from 1 to 8 in the binary number system:
1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111 and 1000.
Whence it is seen that only the numbers 10, 101 and 110 have exactly one zero in the record, i.e. The correct answer is 3.
The only line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains two positive integers separated by a space N and K, not exceeding 109.
In a single line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT need to output one integer - the number of numbers from 1 to N with K zeros in binary representation.
