# Bottles
A group of programmers gathered on Monday and bought “Sprite” in 0.25 l bottles for all their money, not forgetting to take the change.
On Tuesday, they handed over the empty dishes, added the remaining delivery, and again bought as many of the same “Sprite” bottles as they could.
So they acted until Friday. On Friday, having handed over the dishes and adding change from Thursday, they were able to buy only one bottle of drink. In this case, the money they have left.
It is required to write a program that determines the minimum amount that programmers had on Monday.
The input file INPUT.TXT consists of a single line containing two integers F (the cost of one bottle of Sprite) and P (the cost of one empty bottle from under Sprite), separated by a space.
Restrictions: 1 ≤ P <F ≤ 109, the initial amount does not exceed 2 × 109.
In a single line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT you need to output one integer - the minimum amount that programmers had on Monday.
