# Puzzle about the queens
It is likely that many of you have played chess. Therefore, you know that the queen can move along horizontals, verticals and diagonals.
Vasya recently started studying chess and somewhere he read a puzzle in which it was necessary to arrange the maximum number of queens on a 8x8 board so that at least one field would be unbeaten. This problem is easily solved for a 3x3 board, because it is clear that it is impossible to place more than two queens on her in this way.
Help Vasya solve this problem for the N × N board.
The single line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains a positive integer N - the size of the chess board N × N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100).
In the single line of the output OUTPUT.TXT file, you need to output the maximum number of queens that can be placed on an N × N chessboard so that one cell remains uncut.
