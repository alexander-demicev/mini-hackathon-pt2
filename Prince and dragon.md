# Prince and dragon
Wizard Merlin sells magic swords to princes who want to kill a dragon. The main characteristic of the sword is the number of dragon heads that it cuts down per blow. The main characteristic of a dragon is the number of heads that it can grow during a regeneration session. Fights of princes with dragons always proceed the same way - the prince attacks, and hides behind a shield; the dragon attacks with fiery breath and regenerates; This continues until, after the next strike, the dragon runs out of head. It is clear, however, that not every sword can defeat every dragon. The order entering Merlin always contains the number of heads of the dragon and the speed of its regeneration. Count on the known attacking force of the sword, whether the prince can kill such a dragon with such a sword and, if so, how many strokes will be required.
The only line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains the number N - the number of heads that the sword cuts down with one blow. Next comes the number M - the number of dragon heads. It is followed by K - the number of heads that the dragon regenerates at a time (1 ≤ N, M, K ≤ 105). All numbers are separated by a space.
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output the number of strokes that the prince must inflict to kill the dragon, if possible. If you cannot kill a dragon with such a sword, then you should output "NO".
