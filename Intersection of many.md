# Intersection of many
Two unordered sets of integers are given (maybe with repetitions). To issue without repetition in ascending order all those numbers that are found in both sets.
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains two integers N and M (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 300 000) - the number of elements of the first and second sets, respectively. The following lines contain first the N numbers of the first set, and then the M numbers of the second set. Numbers are separated by spaces or line breaks. Each of these numbers falls in the range from 0 to 105.
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT you need to write in ascending order without repeating all the numbers that are included in both the first and the second set. Separate numbers with one space. If there are no such numbers, the output file should remain empty.
