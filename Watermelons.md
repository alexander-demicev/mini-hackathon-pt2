# Watermelons
Ivan Vasilyevich came to the market and decided to buy two watermelons: one for himself and one for his mother-in-law. It is clear that you need to choose a watermelon for yourself, and for your mother-in-law it is easier. But here's the bad luck: there are too many watermelons and he doesnâ€™t know how to choose the lightest and heaviest watermelon? Help him!
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains one number N - the number of watermelons. The second line contains N numbers, separated by spaces. Here each number is the mass of the corresponding watermelon. All numbers are natural and do not exceed 30,000.
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT, you need to output two numbers separated by a space: the mass of watermelon, which Ivan Vasilyevich will buy the mother-in-law and the mass of watermelon, which he will buy for himself.
