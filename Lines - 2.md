# Lines - 2
The set of rows is S = {s1, s2, s3, ..., sn}. It is necessary to find the number of lines si from S, representable as a concatenation of two lines sj and sk from S (si = sjsk, j and k may coincide).
The input file INPUT.TXT contains a set of lines S - one element per line. The i-th line of the input file contains si. The last line of the input file contains the string ENDOFINPUT. It denotes the end of the input data and is not included in S.
All si consist only of small letters of the English alphabet and have a length of from 1 to 100 characters. There are no more than 240 lines in the input file (including the line containing ENDOFINPUT).
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output the answer without leading zeros.
