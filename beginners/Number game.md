# Number game
The number game is played on a one-dimensional array of positive integers. Before the start, the draw is determined by who will go first (the first player) and who will go second (the second player). The process of the game is that players take turns (first the first player, then the second, then the first again, and so on) cross out the numbers from the array. You can delete only the number at the end or the beginning of the remaining array. In this case, the maximum number of these two is always crossed out. If the first and last numbers of the array are equal, then the first is crossed out. The game continues until all numbers are crossed out. Each number crossed out goes to the asset to the player who crossed it out. After the end of the game, each player sums up the numbers crossed out. The winner is the one who scores more points.
Some players realized that the result did not depend on the strategy of the game, and decided to ask you to write a program to get the result.
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains a single integer N - the number of numbers in the array (1 ≤ N ≤ 104). The second line contains N positive integers from the range [1, 32000], separated by a space.
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output two numbers separated by a colon. The first number is the number of points scored by the first player when playing on this array, the second number is for the second.
