# Bottles

## Complexity 48%

A group of programmers gathered on Monday and bought “Sprite” in 0.25 l bottles for all their money, not forgetting to take the change.

On Tuesday, they handed over the empty bottles, added the remaining change, and again bought as many of the same “Sprite” bottles as they could.

They were doing it until Friday. On Friday, having handed over the bottles and adding change from Thursday, they were able to buy only one bottle of drink. In this case, they had no money left.

It is required to write a program that determines the minimum amount that programmers had on Monday.

INPUT consists of a single line containing two integers F (the cost of one bottle of Sprite) and P (the cost of one empty bottle from under Sprite), separated by a space.
Restrictions: 1 ≤ P <F ≤ 109, the initial amount does not exceed 2 × 109.

OUTPUT you need to output one integer - the minimum amount that programmers had on Monday.

| INPUT                             | OUTPUT                 |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| 7 3	  						    | 83                     |
