# N-angle wheel
## Complexity 22%
At one well-known N-merician car factory in the country, the chief engineer-innovator proposed to use wheels in the form of regular N-gons instead of round wheels. "At the same time," he said, "an important indicator of the quality of such a wheel will be the difference between the radius of the circumscribed circle and the radius of the inscribed circle." Moreover, the wheel is considered quality if its quality indicator is less than one.
Given the number N and the length A of the side of the N-angle wheel. It is necessary to determine whether the wheel is of high quality.

INPUT contains two positive integers: N and A (3 ≤ N ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ A ≤ 1000).
OUTPUT output "YES", if it is a quality wheel and "NO" otherwise.
