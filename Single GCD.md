# Single GCD
Given two natural numbers in the decimal number system, consisting of units. In the first number there are exactly N units, and in the second they are exactly M. It is required to find the GCD of these numbers.
Recall that the GCD (the greatest common divisor) of two numbers a and b is the maximum number c, that b is divisible by c and a is divisible by c.
The only line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains two integers N and M (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 2000).
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output the answer without leading zeros.
