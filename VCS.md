# Implement your own [VCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)

Please implement your own Version Control System. You should implement CLI with at least three actions:

* `init` will initialize repo in current directory
* `commit` will collect changes and add them to history
* `checkout [commit]` will set current directory to state which was at the moment of commit

## Limitations

**Not allowed to use:**

* Any already implemented VCS library
* Any already implemented diff library

## Tips

* Check <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff>
