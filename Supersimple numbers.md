# Supersimple numbers
A prime number is a natural number greater than one and divisible only by one and by itself. We write out all the prime numbers in ascending order and the ith number in this order is denoted by pi (the number 2 will have the number 1). For example, p1 = 2, p2 = 3, p3 = 5, p52 = 239.
We say that the number pi is super-simple if i = pk for some k. In other words, a super prime number is a prime number whose number in the list of prime numbers, ordered in ascending order, is a prime number.
Given a positive integer k. Sort all the super-simple numbers in ascending order. Find the kth super prime number in this order.
The input file INPUT.TXT contains a positive integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 500).
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output the k-th super prime number.
