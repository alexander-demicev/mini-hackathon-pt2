# Easy calculation
Given a natural number n. It is necessary to translate it into a k-ary number system and find the difference between the product and the sum of its numbers in this number system.
For example, let n = 239, k = 8. Then the representation of the number n in the octal number system is 357, and the answer to the problem is 3 × 5 × 7 - (3 + 5 + 7) = 90.
The input file INPUT.TXT contains two natural numbers: n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 109, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10). Both of these numbers are given in decimal notation.
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output the answer to the problem (in decimal notation).
