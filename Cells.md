# Cells
It is known that a chessboard has a dimension of 8x8 and consists of cells of 2 colors, for example, black and white (see figure). Each cell has a coordinate consisting of a letter and a number. The horizontal location of the cell is determined by the letter from A to H, and the vertical - by the digit from 1 to 8. Note that the cell with the A1 coordinate is black. It is required for a given coordinate to determine the color of the cell.
The single line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains the coordinate of the cell on the chessboard: there are only two characters - a letter and a number (without spaces).
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT, you need to output "WHITE" if the specified cell is white and "BLACK" if it is black.
