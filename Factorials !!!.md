# Factorials !!!
Definition 1:
n !! ...! = n (nk) (n-2k) ... (n mod k), if n is not divisible by k,
n !! ...! = n (nk) (n-2k) ... k, if n is divisible by k (signs! in both cases, k pieces).
Definition 2:
X mod Y - the remainder of dividing X by Y.
For example, 10 mod 3 = 1; 3! = 3 • 2 • 1; ten!!! = 10 • 7 • 4 • 1;
We are given n and k were able to calculate the value of the expression from definition 1. Are you weak?
The input file INPUT.TXT contains exactly one line. First, an integer n, (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), then exactly one space, then k exclamation marks (1 ≤ k ≤ 20).
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output one number - the value n !! ..! .
