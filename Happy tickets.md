# Happy tickets
It is required to calculate the number of N - digit happy tickets. Recall that a ticket is called happy if the sum of the first half of its figures is equal to the sum of the other half. For example, ticket 064109 is happy, because 0 + 6 + 4 = 1 + 0 + 9.
The only line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains a positive even number N (N â‰¤ 100) - the number of digits in the ticket.
In a single line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT, you need to output one integer - the number of N-digit lucky tickets.
