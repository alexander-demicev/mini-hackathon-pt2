# Nature reserves
In the paradise valley are N reserves, shaped like rectangles. Once at a meeting of directors, it was decided to increase the area of reserves. For this, the director of each reserve chose Ri - the number of meters by which he wants to increase the zone of his reserve, see the figure. However, after signing the agreement, it became clear that some reserves have common lands. It was decided to merge such reserves into one, if the united reserve intersected with another reserve, they were again combined, and so until the reserve (s) were left without common lands.
Your task is to count how many reserves have become in the valley after unification.
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains the number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) - the number of reserves. Then there are N lines containing five integers x1, y1, x2, y2, R. (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) - coordinates of the opposite peaks of the reserve in meters (-104 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 104 ). The sides of the reserves are parallel to the axes of coordinates. Reserves that have a common border are considered overlapping. R (0 ≤ R ≤ 104) - the distance by which the boundary of the reserve moves away.
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output one positive integer - the number of remaining reserves after the merger.
