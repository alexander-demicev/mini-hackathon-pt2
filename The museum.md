# The museum
The museum registers during the day the time of arrival and departure of each visitor. Thus, for the day, N pairs of values were obtained, where the first value in the pair indicates the time of arrival of the visitor and the second value - the time of his departure. It is required to find the maximum number of visitors who were in the museum at the same time.
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains a natural number N (N <105) - the number of visitors registered in the museum during the day. Next, there are N lines with information about the time of visitors' visits: each line contains the length of time of the visit in the format “HH: MM HH: MM” (00:00 ≤ HH: MM ≤ 23:59).
In a single line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT need to output a single integer - the maximum number of visitors simultaneously in the museum.
