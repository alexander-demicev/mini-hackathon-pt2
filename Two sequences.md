# Two sequences
We define the sequences an and bn as follows: a1 = 2, a2 = 3, a3 = 4, a4 = 7, a5 = 13, an = bn − 1 + bn − 3, n> 5, bn is a sequence of numbers that are not included in an, recorded in ascending order.
Thus, the sequence an will look like this: 2, 3, 4, 7, 13, 15, ..., and the sequence bn - 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, ....
Your task is to find an and bn.
The input file contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000).
In the first line of the output file output an, in the second - bn.
