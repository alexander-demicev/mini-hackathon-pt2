# Convex hull
Consider an endless sheet of checkered paper. Paint a number of cells in black. Now we want to paint over the minimum number of cells, so that the set of black cells becomes convex.
Recall that a geometric figure Φ is called convex if for any points A from Φ and В from Φ with real coordinates, the segment [AB] belongs to Φ.
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains two numbers N and M (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100) - the size of a piece of paper, where all the black cells fell. Each of the following N lines contains M characters "*" or ".". The symbol "*" denotes a black cell, and "." A white one.
In the output OUTPUT.TXT file, output a convex set containing the minimum number of additionally painted black cells in exactly N lines with M characters "*" or "." In each.
