# Keyboard
For a given letter of the English alphabet, you need to display a standing letter on the standard keyboard. In this case, the keyboard is closed, i.e. to the right of the letter “p” stands the letter “a”, from the letter “l” stands the letter “z”, and from the letter “m” - the letter “q”.
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains one character - a small letter of the English alphabet.
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT, you should output the letter to the right of the specified letter, taking into account the closedness of the keyboard.
