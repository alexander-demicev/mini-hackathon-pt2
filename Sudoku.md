# Sudoku
Sudoku of size n is called a square with side n2, divided into n2 medium squares with side n, each of which is divided into n2 small squares. Each small square contains a number from 1 to n2.
Sudoku is called correct if all the numbers from 1 to n2 are found in every column, every line and every average square.
Recently Vasya drew Sudoku of size n. Your task is to help him determine if he is correct.
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains the number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10). The following n2 lines contain n2 numbers each that define the drawn Vasya Sudoku.
All numbers in the input file are natural and do not exceed 100 in absolute value.
If Sudoku is correct, output the word "Correct" in the output OUTPUT.TXT file, otherwise output "Incorrect".
