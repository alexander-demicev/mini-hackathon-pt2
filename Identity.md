# Identity
You need to check Vasi Pupkin's homework, in which he wrote equality. For example, a record of the form “2 + 3 = 5” is correct, and “23 * 7 = 421” is incorrect, but correct. The correct entry of the expression will be called the sequence: number, operation ("+", "-", "*", "/"), number, equal sign, number. The number will be considered a sequence of one or more decimal digits, in front of which there can be one minus sign. There are no spaces in the correct expression record.
If the entry does not match the described rule, then it is considered incorrect. For example, the entries "2 * = 3", "173" and "2 + 2 = a" are incorrect.
The INPUT.TXT input file consists of a single line containing an arithmetic expression record. All numbers in the record do not exceed the absolute value of 30,000. The length of an arithmetic expression can be from 0 to 100 characters.
In the output OUTPUT.TXT file, output “YES” if the specified entry is correct (ie, equality is an identity), “NO” if correct, but incorrect, and ERROR if the entry is incorrect.
