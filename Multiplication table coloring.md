# Multiplication table coloring
The multiplication table is a table of size n lines per m columns, in which at the intersection of the i-th row and j-th column is the number i ∙ j (rows and columns are numbered from one).
In one of the mathematical schools, it was decided to conduct a pedagogical experiment. To make it easier for students to memorize the multiplication table, some numbers in it will be painted in red, some in blue and some in green (the remaining numbers will be black).
The process of painting numbers can be divided into four stages. In the first stage, all the numbers are painted black. On the second - all even numbers are painted in red, on the third - all numbers divisible by 3, painted green, on the fourth - all numbers divisible by 5 are painted blue.
The school principal wants to know how many printer cartridges need to be purchased for printing tables. Therefore, he needs information on how many numbers of which color will be in one colored multiplication table n by m. Write a program that solves the problem of counting the corresponding quantities.
The input file INPUT.TXT contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000).
In the first line of the output OUTPUT.TXT file output the number of numbers colored in red, in the second - in green, in the third - in blue, in the fourth - in black. Follow the format given in the examples.
