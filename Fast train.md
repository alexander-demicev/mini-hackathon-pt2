# Fast train
Between the two largest cities of our country St. Petersburg and Moscow make daily flights of n trains. For each train, it is known its departure time from St. Petersburg and the time of arrival in Moscow.
Find the fastest train and its speed in the assumption that the length of the railway between St. Petersburg and Moscow is 650 km.
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the next n lines describes exactly one train.
A train description consists of its name, departure time and arrival time. The name of the train is a string from 1 to 50 characters long, enclosed in quotes. It can contain English letters, spaces, numbers, dashes (“-”) and underscores (“_”). Departure and arrival times are given in HH: MM format. Lowercase and uppercase letters in train names are different.
Travel time for each of the trains is at least one minute and does not exceed 24 hours.
It is guaranteed that the fastest train is determined uniquely.
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT output the name of the fastest train and its speed. Output the speed in kilometers per hour and round to the nearest integer by mathematical rules. Follow the output format given in the examples.
