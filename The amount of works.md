# The amount of works
It is required to calculate the sum of the products of digits of each N-digit number. It should be noted that if the number 0 is found in a number, the product of its numbers is zero. For N = 3, the required amount is presented as follows:

S = 1*0*0 + 1*0*1 + 1*0*2 + â€¦ + 9*9*8 + 9*9*9 = 91125
The single line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains a positive integer N (N <1000).
In a single line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT need to output a single integer - the sum of the products of the digits of all N-digit numbers.
