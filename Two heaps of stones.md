# Two heaps of stones
You have N stones with masses W1, W2, ... WN. It is required to decompose the stones into 2 piles so that the mass difference of these piles is minimal.
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains the number N - the number of stones (1 ≤ N ≤ 18). In the second line, the spaces of stones W1, W2, ... WN (1 ≤ Wi ≤ 105) are listed separated by spaces.
In a single line of the output file OUTPUT.TXT, you need to output one non-negative integer - the minimum possible difference between the masses of two piles.
