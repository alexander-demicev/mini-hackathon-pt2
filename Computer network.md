The Masha and Bears company is the largest Internet provider in the whole forest. That is why, with the request to connect them to the Internet turned N pigs. Pig houses are located at various points (xi, yi). The nearest connection point is located at (xnet, ynet).
Pigs pay money depending on the length of the wire. The amount of money they have is limited and amounts to p tugriks. They want to determine whether they have enough money to connect? It is also known that the unit length of the wire is c tugriks. Help them do the necessary calculations!
The first line of the input file INPUT.TXT contains the numbers N, c and p are integers with the following restrictions: 1 ≤ N ≤ 103, 0 ≤ c ≤ 104, 0 ≤ p ≤ 1015. The next N lines contain the coordinates of the piglet houses (xi; yi). The last line contains the coordinates of the junction point (xnet, ynet). All coordinates are integer and do not exceed 1000 in absolute value. It is guaranteed that the total wire length required for connection is either whole or differs from the whole by more than 10-2.
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT, you should output "YES" if the piglets have enough money to connect and "NO" otherwise.
